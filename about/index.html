	<h3>about</h3>
		<p>Hi there, I'm Sasha. Recent Betamore Academy graduate through their front-end web development course currently moonlighting as a website developer.

I am an alumnus of Goucher College graduating with a Bachelors of Arts with dual majors in Psychology and Spanish. Currently I reside in the charming city of Baltimore, Maryland but I am up for adventure far.

I want to be involved in projects that I can be proud of, join an amazing team, and advance my design and development career. Take some time to look at my work, credentials, and if you're interested in helping me make this happen, let's get in touch.p>
